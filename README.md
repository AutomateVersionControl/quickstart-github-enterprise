## GitHub Enterprise on the AWS Cloud
AWS provides a comprehensive set of services and tools for deploying Microsoft Windows-based workloads on its highly reliable and secure cloud infrastructure. This Quick Start deploys GitHub Enterprise on the AWS Cloud.

GitHub Enterprise is a development and collaboration platform built on Git that enables developers to build and share software easily and effectively. It provides an integrated platform for continuous integration and development, a non-linear workflow for collaboration, and in-depth monitoring and auditing for administrators. By deploying GitHub Enterprise on AWS, you can take advantage of a configurable infrastructure for your coding and deployment tasks.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy GitHub Enterprise in your AWS account. The Quick Start automates the following:

* Deployment of GitHub Enterprise into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment) 
* Deployment of GitHub Enterprise into an existing VPC

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
