== Test the deployment

The Quick Start sets up a sample organization and repository during the deployment
process. You can test the deployment by accessing the GitHub Enterprise EC2 instance,
accessing the sample repository, and cloning it.

1. Use the URL of the primary instance displayed in the Outputs tab for the stack to view the resources that were created.
2. Log in to GitHub Enterprise. Enter the site administrator user name and password you provided in the Quick Start parameters.
